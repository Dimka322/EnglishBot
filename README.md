# EnglishBot
Issa my Telegram chatbot for university coursework. There you can learn new academic english words and then try to pass a test or even analyze your errors during test.
Chatbot system depends on "states" system, so you won't be able to do anything forbidden at a certain point of time. 
All commands starts with "/", also you can call command by its meaning. For example, "Тестирование по переводу слов". 
To start this bot you need to initialize bot work by typing him "/start" or pressing "Start" button.

There are several test types, so you can try your best in translating, searching missed words, finding definition or even doing reverse translate.
My next goal is create CNN for recognizing audio signals. If I do it, there will be an other test type where you can prononse phrases.
